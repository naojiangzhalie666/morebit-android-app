     * when the activity has a single parent activity. If the activity doesn't have a single parent
     * activity then don't define one and this method will use back button functionality. If "Up"
     * functionality is still desired for activities without parents then use {@code
     * syntheticParentActivity} to define one dynamically.
     * <p/>
     * Note: Up navigation intents are represented by a back arrow in the top left of the Toolbar in
     * Material Design guidelines.
